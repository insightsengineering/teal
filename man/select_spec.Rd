\usage{
select_spec(
  choices,
  selected = if (is(choices, "delayed_data")) NULL else choices[1],

}
\arguments{
\item{choices}{(\code{character}) or (\code{delayed_data}) object.
Named character vector to define the choices
of a shiny \code{\link[shiny]{selectInput}}. These have to be columns in the
dataset defined in the \link{data_extract_spec} where this is called.
\code{delayed_data} objects can be created via \code{variable_choices} or \code{value_choices}.}

\item{selected}{optional (\code{character} or \code{NULL}).
Named character vector to define the selected values of a shiny \code{\link[shiny]{selectInput}}.
Defaults to the first value of \code{choices} or \code{NULL} for delayed data loading.}

\item{multiple}{(\code{logical}) Whether multiple values shall be allowed in the
shiny \code{\link[shiny]{selectInput}}.}

\item{fixed}{optional (\code{logical}). \link{data_extract_spec} specific feature to
hide the choices selected in case they are not needed. Setting fixed to \code{TRUE}
will not allow the user to select columns. It will then lead to a selection of
columns in the dataset that is defined by the developer of the app.}

\item{always_selected}{(\code{character}) Additional column names from the data set that should
always be selected}

\item{label}{optional (\code{logical}). Define a label
on top of this specific shiny \code{\link[shiny]{selectInput}}.}
}
\value{
A \code{select_spec}-S3 class object or \code{delayed_select_spec}-S3-class object.
It contains all input values.
If \code{select_spec}, then the function double checks the \code{choices} and \code{selected} inputs.
}
\description{
\code{select_spec} is used inside teal to create a \code{\link[shiny]{selectInput}}
that will select columns from a dataset.
}
\details{
To give you some more insights into this function there are several examples. These all
start by a data set containing the columns \code{"AGE"}, \code{"AVAL"} and \code{"BMRKR1"}.

\enumerate{
  \item{Selection with just one column allowed }{
    \preformatted{
select = select_spec(
  choices = c("AVAL", "BMRKR1", "AGE"),
  selected = c("AVAL"),

  fixed = FALSE,
  label = "Column"
