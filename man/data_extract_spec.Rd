\title{Data Extract input for teal modules}
\usage{
data_extract_spec(dataname, select = NULL, filter = NULL, reshape = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataname}{(\code{character}) The name of the \code{teal} dataset to
be extracted. This dataset has to be handed over to the \code{data} argument of the
\code{\link[teal]{init}} function.}

\item{select}{(\code{NULL} or \code{select_spec}-S3 class or \code{delayed_select_spec}-S3-class object)
Columns to be selected from the input dataset
mentioned in \code{dataname}. The setup can be created using \code{\link{select_spec}} function.}

\item{filter}{(\code{NULL} or \code{filter_spec} or its respective delayed version)
Setup of the filtering of key columns inside the dataset.
This setup can be created using the \code{\link{filter_spec}} function.
Please note that both select and filter cannot be empty at the same time.}

\item{reshape}{(\code{logical}) whether reshape long to wide. Note that it will be used only in case of long dataset
with multiple keys selected in filter part.}

The Data Extract input can be used to filter and select columns from a data
set. This function enables such an input in teal.
Please use the constructor function \code{\link{data_extract_spec}} to set it up.

Note that no checks based on columns can be done because the data is only referred to by name.

\section{Module Development}{

\describe{
From this function's output a \code{teal.devel::data_extract_input} can
be constructed. This input can be read by a \code{teal.devel::data_extract_module} module.
}
}
