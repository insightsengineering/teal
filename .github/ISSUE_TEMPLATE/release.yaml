        - [ ] Recurring tasks: Monitor integration tests, if integration fails, create priority issues on the board.
        - [ ] Sanity checks for Shiny applications e.g. checking if Shiny apps are deployable and making sure there are no errors/warnings.
        - [ ] Update NEWS.md file: make sure it reflects a holistic summary of what has changed in the package, check README.

Note that tags are created in GitHub and synchronized with GitLab automatically.
        - [ ] The package is submitted for internal validation by Release Coordinator (Applicable only for regulatory release).
        - [ ] Address any feedback (internal validation/user testing), retag the package as a release candidate vX.X.X-rc(n+1). Repeat the submission for internal validation if necessary.
