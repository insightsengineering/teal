`teal` is a shiny-based interactive exploration framework for analyzing data. `teal` applications require app developers to specify:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD007 MD030 -->
-   Data, which can be:
    -    `CDISC` data, commonly used for clinical trial reporting
    -    Independent datasets, for example from a `data.frame`
    -    Related datasets, for example a set of `data.frames` with key columns to enable data joins
    -    `MultiAssayExperiment` objects which are R data structures for representing and analyzing multi-omics experiments
-   `teal` modules:
    -   `teal modules` are shiny modules built within the `teal` framework that specify analysis to be performed. For example, it can be a module for exploring outliers in the data, or a module for visualizing the data in line plots. Although these can be created from scratch, lost of `teal` modules have been released and we recommend starting with modules found in the following packages:
        -   [`teal.modules.general`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.modules.general/): general modules for exploring relational/independent/`CDISC` data
        -   [`teal.modules.clinical`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.modules.clinical/): modules specific to `CDISC` data and clinical trial reporting
        -   [`teal.modules.hermes`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.modules.hermes/): modules for analyzing `MultiAssayExperiment` objects

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD007 MD030 -->

A lot of the functionality of the `teal` framework derives from the following packages:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD007 MD030 -->
-   [`teal.data`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.data/): creating and loading the data needed for `teal` applications.
-   [`teal.widgets`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.widgets/): shiny components used within `teal`.
-   [`teal.slice`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.slice/): provides a filtering panel to allow filtering of data.
-   [`teal.code`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.code/): handles reproducibility of outputs.
-   [`teal.transform`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.transform/): standardizes extracting and merging data.
-   [`teal.logger`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.logger/): standardizes logging within `teal` framework.
-   [`teal.reporter`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.reporter/): allows `teal` applications to generate reports.

## Installation

```r
install.packages("teal", repos = c("https://insightsengineering.r-universe.dev", getOption("repos")))

# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("insightsengineering/teal@*release")
```

Alternatively, you might also use the development version.

```r
install.packages("teal", repos = c("https://pharmaverse.r-universe.dev", getOption("repos")))

# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("insightsengineering/teal")
```

## Usage

```r
library(teal)

app <- init(
  data = teal_data(
    dataset("iris", iris)
  ),
  modules = list(
    module(
      "iris histogram",
      server = function(input, output, session, data) {
        output$hist <- renderPlot(
          hist(data[["iris"]]()[[input$var]])
        )
      },
      ui = function(id, data, ...) {
        ns <- NS(id)
        list(
          shiny::selectInput(
            ns("var"),
            "Column name",
            names(data[["iris"]]())[1:4]
          ),
          plotOutput(ns("hist"))
        )
      }
    )
  )
)

shinyApp(app$ui, app$server)
```
