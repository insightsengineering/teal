*teal* is a shiny-based interactive exploration framework for analyzing data. `teal` applications require app developers to specify:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD007 MD030 -->
-   Data, which can be:
    -    CDISC data, commonly used for clinical trial reporting
    -    Independent datasets, for example from a `data.frame`
    -    Related datasets, for example a set of `data.frames` with key columns to enable data joins
    -    `MultiAssayExperiment` objects which are R data structures for representing and analyzing multi-omics experiments
-   `teal` modules:
    -   `teal modules` are shiny modules built within the `teal` framework that specify analysis to be performed. For example, it can be a module for exploring outliers in the data, or a module for visualizing the data in line plots. Although these can be created from scratch, lost of `teal` modules have been released and we recommend starting with modules found in the following packages:
        -   [`teal.modules.general`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.modules.general): general modules for exploring relational/independent/CDISC data
        -   [`teal.modules.clinical`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.modules.clinical): modules specific to CDISC data and clinical trial reporting
        -   [`teal.modules.hermes`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.modules.hermes): modules for analyzing `MultiAssayExperiment` objects

A lot of the functionality of the `teal` framework derives from the following packages:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD007 MD030 -->
-   [`teal.data`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.data): creating and loading the data needed for `teal` applications.
-   [`teal.widgets`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.widgets): shiny components used within `teal`.
-   [`teal.slice`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.slice): provides a filtering panel to allow filtering of data.
-   [`teal.code`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.code): handles reproducibility of outputs.
-   [`teal.transform`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.transform): standardizes extracting and merging data.
-   [`teal.logger`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.logger): standardizes logging within `teal` framework.
-   [`teal.reporter`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.reporter): allows `teal` applications to generate reports.

## Installation

For releases from August 2022 it is recommended that you [create and use a Github PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) to install the latest version of this package. Once you have the PAT, run the following:

```r
Sys.setenv(GITHUB_PAT = "your_access_token_here")
if (!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("insightsengineering/teal@*release")
```

In order to run many of the examples you will also need to install the [`scda`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/scda) package.

A stable release of all `NEST` packages from June 2022 is also available [here](https://github.com/insightsengineering/depository#readme).

See package vignettes `browseVignettes(package = "teal")` for usage of this package.
