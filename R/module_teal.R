#' Teal app UI
#'
#' This is the main teal UI that puts everything together.
#'
#' It displays the splash UI which is used to fetch the data, possibly
#' prompting for a password input to fetch the data. Once the data is ready,
#' the splash screen is replaced by the actual teal UI that is tabsetted and
#' has a filter panel with datanames that are relevant for the current tab.
#' Nested tabs are possible, but we limit it to two nesting levels for reasons
#' of clarity of the UI.
#'
#' The splash screen functionality can also be used
#' for non-delayed data which takes time to load into memory, avoiding
#' Shiny session timeouts.
#'
#' Bookmarking is supported, i.e. the datasets filter state that this class
#' is responsible for is stored in and restored from the bookmarked state.
#'
#' It is written as a Shiny module so it can be added into other apps as well.
#'
#' @param id module id
#' @param splash_ui `shiny.tag` UI to display initially,
#'   can be a splash screen or a Shiny module UI. For the latter, see
#'   \code{\link{init}} about how to call the corresponding server function.
#' @param title (`character`) The browser window title (defaults to the host URL of the page)
#' @param header `shiny.tag or character` header to display above the app
#' @param footer `shiny.tag or character` footer to display below the app
#'
#' @return `HTML` for Shiny module UI
