#' Server module to set initial filter state
#'
#'
#' Initial filter state is set to:
#' 1. state defined by developer in the `filter` argument of `init`
#' 2. When app is restored from with bookmark state, then filter-state from
#' the URL attributes is set. Bookmark state has a priority over `filter`
#' argument.
#'
#' @details
#' The Shiny bookmarking functionality by default only stores inputs.
#' We need to add `FilteredData` object to the state so we restore it as well.
#' To test bookmarking, include the `bookmark_module`, click on the bookmark
#' button and then get the link. Keep the Shiny app running and open the
#' obtained link in another browser tab.
