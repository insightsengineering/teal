## Introduction

We offer the easy application of a custom bootstrap theme to a `teal::init` app. 
Teal is a consumer of the `bslib` R package which provides tools for customizing Bootstrap themes e.g. of Shiny apps.

## Usage

Teal users have the benefit of custom bootstrap themes by specifying the `teal.bs_theme` R option, which has to be set to `bslib::bs_theme` object.
The `bslib::bs_theme(...)` function creates a Bootstrap theme object, where you should specify the (major) Bootstrap version (default or one of 3, 4 or 5).
Optionally you could choose a **`bootswatch` theme** and **customize the app css** with functions like `bslib::bs_add_rules`.
Please read more about custom themes in [the `bslib` getting started vignette](https://rstudio.github.io/bslib/articles/bslib.html).
The `teal.bs_theme` R option has to be specified at the top of the code script.

Please install `bslib` package before you run the code below.

### `teal.bs_theme` R option

```
options("teal.bs_theme" = bslib::bs_theme("Custom Options"))

#######################
# teal::init() app code

```

### bootstrap version and themes

The best and recommended ways to **explore** the bootstrap themes are to use `bslib::run_with_themer(shinyApp(app$ui, app$server))` or `bslib::bs_theme_preview()`,
both functions offer an interactive explore mode.
Note that the interactive theming for Bootstrap 3 is not supported.
The `bslib::bs_theme_preview()` is recommended when the end user does not have any shiny app yet. 
When you already have a shiny app and you want to test different bootstrap themes (and css styling) then `bslib::run_with_themer(shinyApp(app$ui, app$server))` is recommended.

Available bootstrap versions could be checked with `bslib::versions()` and bootstrap themes (`bootswatch`) with `bslib::bootswatch_themes(version = "5")`.

```
# bslib::versions()
# bslib::bootswatch_themes(version = "5")
options("teal.bs_theme" = bslib::bs_theme(version = "5", bootswatch = "lux")
# or
options("teal.bs_theme" = bslib::bs_theme_update(bslib::bs_theme(version = "5"), bootswatch = "lux"))
```

Specifying only the bootstrap theme in many scenarios is not enough, please read the next section "Default bootstrap theme".

### Default bootstrap theme

When using the default `bslib` theme for any version (3, 4 or 5) its styling might not be as expected.
Please run the interactive `themer` (recommended) or apply a custom theme to explore all the theme options. **In many scenarios updating only the theme might not be enough and e.g. font color and other specifications should be updated too.**

```
# instead of
options("teal.bs_theme" =  bslib::bs_theme(version = "5"))
# try non-default themes
options("teal.bs_theme" = bslib::bs_theme(version = "5", bootswatch = "THEME NAME". ...))
# or run the app inside bslib::run_with_themer
```

### Reset the bootstrap theme

Please use the `options("teal.bs_theme" = NULL)` call to return to the default shiny bootstrap for teal apps.

### Theme not updated

One reason the theme is not updated could be the problem that a browser caches the previous one, especially when we run different themes one after another.
Please, use the "Cmd+Shift+R" (Mac) or "Ctrl+F5" (Windows) to hard refresh the webpage.

### Custom teal css

The most important `teal` html tags have a proper id/class, so they could be directly styled.
The `bslib::bs_add_rules` function could be used around the `bslib::bs_theme` object to apply custom css rules.

```
library(magrittr)
options("teal.bs_theme" = bslib::bs_theme(version = "5") %>% bslib::bs_add_rules("Anything understood by sass::as_sass()"))
```

Other `bslib::bs_add_*` family functions could be used to specify low-level bootstrap elements.

### Bootstrap NULL vs 3

It is important to note the difference between `options("teal.bs_theme" = NULL)` and `options("teal.bs_theme" = bslib::bs_theme(version = "3")`.
The small differences could comes from the `bslib` approximation of the default shiny bootstrap for version 3.
An important difference is that when using `bslib::bs_theme(version = "3", bootswatch = "THEME NAME")` we could apply the custom bootstrap theme.
Another difference is that the usage of `bslib::bs_theme(version = "3")` requires the installation of the newest `shinyWidgets` package from the main branch, see below.

```
# Downloading the newest shinyWidgets
# needed only when bslib::bs_theme(version = "3", ...) is used
remotes::install_github("https://github.com/dreamRs/shinyWidgets@main")
```

### Regular `shiny::fluidPage`

If you want to update the theme in the regular `shiny::fluidPage` like app, you do not need the `teal.bs_theme` option. Then simply provide the `bslib::bs_theme` directly to the `shiny::fluidPage(theme = bslib::bs_theme(...), ...)`. 

### Examples

With `bslib::run_with_themer` to explore different themes.
Please, remember that the interactive theming for Bootstrap 3 is not supported.


```{r, message=FALSE}
options("teal.bs_theme" = bslib::bs_theme(version = "5"))
library(teal)

app <- init(
  data = teal_data(
    dataset("IRIS", iris),
    dataset("MTCARS", mtcars)
  ),
  modules = list(example_module(), example_module()),
  header = "My first teal application"
)

if (interactive()) {
  # Run with themer
  bslib::run_with_themer(shinyApp(app$ui, app$server))
}
```

Apply the already chosen theme with `options("teal.bs_theme" = bslib::bs_theme(...))`, 
in this example the `lux` theme from `bootstrap` version 5.

```{r, message=FALSE}
options("teal.bs_theme" = bslib::bs_theme(version = "5", bootswatch = "lux"))
library(teal)

app <- init(
  data = teal_data(
    dataset("IRIS", iris),
    dataset("MTCARS", mtcars)
  ),
  modules = list(example_module(), example_module()),
  header = "My first teal application"
)

if (interactive()) {
  shinyApp(app$ui, app$server)
}
```
