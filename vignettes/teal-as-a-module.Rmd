# Introduction

A Shiny developer interested in embedding Teal application into its own app, can use the Teal module composed of `ui_teal()` and `srv_teal()` functions. 
Unlike `init()`, this module will not automatically include session info footer, but it is possible to add it manually with `ui_session_info()` and `srv_session_info()`.
Using Teal as modules offers several advantages such as:

- Including one or multiple Teal applications in other app.
- Run Teal applications based on the dynamically created components like initial data, modules, filters.

# Example

Example below demonstrates how to embed Teal as a module in a Shiny application. 
Here, `srv_teal()` is called using the reactive `teal_data` object passed from the server of the parent app.

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
library(teal)

data <- teal_data() |> within({
  iris <- iris
  mtcars <- mtcars
  df <- data.frame(a = 1:10, b = letters[1:10])
})

mods <- modules(
  example_module("mod1"),
  example_module("mod2")
)

ui_app <- fluidPage(
  title = "Your app with teal as a module",
  selectInput("datasets", "Select datasets", choices = c("iris", "mtcars", "df"), selected = "iris", multiple = TRUE),
  ui_teal("teal", mods),
  ui_session_info("session_info")
)

srv_app <- function(input, output, session) {
  data_subset <- reactive(data[input$datasets])
  srv_teal("teal", data = data_subset, modules = mods)
  srv_session_info("session_info")
}

if (interactive()) {
  shinyApp(ui_app, srv_app)
}
```
