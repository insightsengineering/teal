## Introduction

*teal* is a shiny-based interactive exploration framework for analyzing data, with particular emphasis on
CDISC clinical trial data. `teal` applications provide their users with:

* Ability to "pull" in data from external data sources 
* Dynamic filtering of data to be used in the analyses
* Ability to generate reproducible code to regenerate the on-screen analyses

`teal` applications also provide application developers with:

* A large suite of customizable standard analysis modules to be including in applications
* A logging framework to facilitate debugging of applications. 

More advanced users of the framework can also create new analysis modules which can be added into any teal applications.
See the vignette [LINK TODO] for a brief introduction to creating modules.

## Your first `teal` application:

```
library(teal)

app <- init(
  data = teal_data(
    dataset("IRIS", iris),
    dataset("MTCARS", mtcars)
  ),
  modules = modules(example_module()),
  header = "My first teal application"
)

runApp(app)
```

## Where to go next

To learn more about the `teal` framework we first recommend exploring some of the available
analysis modules: see for example:
* [general analysis modules](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.modules.general/)
* [clinical trial reporting modules](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.modules.clinical/)
* [modules for analyzing `MultiAssayExperiment` objects]((https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.modules.hermes/))

The packages `teal` requires, which are of most interest when defining applications, provide more in-depth information:

* [`teal.data`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.data/): defining data for `teal` application.
* [`teal.transform`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.transform/): defining the way arguments are passed into `teal` modules.
