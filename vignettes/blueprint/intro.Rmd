`teal` is an interactive data exploration framework based on Shiny, designed with emphasis on analyzing CDISC clinical trial data.

A Shiny Application created with `teal` offers users the ability to:

- Import data from external sources;
- Dynamically filter data for analysis;
- Generate reproducible code for future analysis
- Create downloadable reports of analysis results _(for analysis modules that support reporting)_.

Moreover, the `teal` framework provides application developers with a wide range of customizable standard analysis modules to integrate into their applications, along with a logging framework that helps facilitate debugging.
Additionally, advanced users of the framework can develop new analysis modules and easily integrate them into any `teal` application.

The `teal` framework's functionality draws heavily from the following packages:  

| R package            | Description                                                             |

|[`teal.code`](https://github.com/insightsengineering/teal.code)           | handles reproducibility of outputs|
|[`teal.transform`](https://github.com/insightsengineering/teal.transform) | standardizes extracting and merging data|
|[`teal.logger`](https://github.com/insightsengineering/teal.logger)       | standardizes logging within `teal` framework|
|[`teal.reporter`](https://github.com/insightsengineering/teal.reporter)   | allows `teal` applications to generate reports|

Although these packages are mentioned in the material, we strongly recommend visiting their vignettes to learn more about them.
