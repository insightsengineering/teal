## Introduction

The filter panel is a key component of the `teal` framework, providing a powerful tool for exploring and analyzing data.

One of the great things about the filter panel is that it comes built-in with `teal`, requiring no programming knowledge to use.

The filter panel provides a convenient way for users to subset their data, simplifying the process of exploration and comprehension.
Moreover, users can activate or deactivate filter states interactively, either individually or globally, using the filter panel.

The `teal.slice` R package in the `teal` framework is responsible for managing the filter panel.

```

The filter panel plays a crucial role in the `teal` framework by processing the application data and creating appropriate filters the user can interact with.
While processing the data, the filter panel identifies the data type of each column in the dataset, such as numeric, categorical, or date.
Based on the column type, the filter panel generates shiny inputs appropriate for each column.

These shiny inputs enable users to interact with the data by adding filters that subsets the data accordingly. For example, if a column is numeric, users can use a slider to enter a range of values, while for categorical columns, users can use a dropdown menu or a set of checkboxes to select specific categories.
The `teal.slice` functionality makes it easy for users to filter the data based on their specific requirements.

As users interact with these shiny inputs, the filter panel applies the filters to the data. At the same time, the filter panel also saves the filtering R code, which both records the specific filters applied to the data and a signature of that data.
This is important for reproducibility, as it allows users to revisit the same filtering process in the future and obtain the same results from the same dataset.

Once the filtering process is complete, the filtered dataset is transfered to the `teal` module for analysis processing via a reactive dataset.
This module may perform various types of analysis on the filtered data, such as statistic
