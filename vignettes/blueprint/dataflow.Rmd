The sequence diagram above illustrates the different stages that data goes through within the `teal` framework, supported by the `teal.slice` R package:

1. Data is loaded into the `teal` app;
    - See the [Filter panel vignette](filter_panel.html) for details;
2. Data is passed to the filter panel;
    - Users _(or app developers)_ can specify filters to apply;
    - Filters can be specified globally, for the whole app, or for specific modules;
3. Filtered data is sent to `teal` modules for analysis;
    - Each module creates a [`qenv`](qenv.html) object track the code that is be applied to the data _(and used for reproducibility)_;

Whenever filters are added or removed, the data coming into modules is re-computed, providing the `teal` module with new filtered data to conduct the required analysis.
