Welcome to `teal` Technical Blueprint documentation!

The purpose of this material is to aid new developer's comprehension of the fundamental principles of the `teal` framework.
We will explore crucial `teal` concepts such as data flow, actors, and filter panel, among others.

While this material will be presented at a high-level, we will direct you to our remarkable vignettes for a more in-depth understanding.

Our hope is that this resource will provide new developers with a strong grasp of `teal` products, enabling them to contribute to code with confidence.

The NEST initiative from Roche/Genentech launched `teal`, which is being made possible by the Core Development team within NEST.
