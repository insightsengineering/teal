## Introduction

The `teal` framework leverages the [`shiny` module concept](https://rstudio.github.io/shiny/reference/moduleServer.html) to enable encapsulation of analytical actions in `teal` modules, while maintaining seamless communication between the modules and the application.


## Benefits

By implementing the modular app technique from the shiny module into the creation of the teal module, several benefits are realized:

1. Streamlined maintenance  
  The development of the teal module becomes more manageable, as it can function independently from the teal framework. 
  This separation allows developers to maintain the module with ease. This approach has been successfully applied in R packages dedicated to teal module development, such as `teal.modules.general` and `teal.modules.clinical`.

1. Enhanced focus on output  
  `teal` module developers can concentrate solely on refining parameters or encoding, and output aspects (such as data summarization and visualization) without the need to concern themselves with the intricacies of the teal framework. 
  When developed correctly, the module seamlessly integrates with `teal`.

1. Facilitated Collaboration  
  `teal` module development becomes an accessible entry point for developers interested in collaborating. 
  This approach encourages user collaboration for the improvement of teal modules, as developers gain a deeper understanding of the mechanics of the teal framework.
