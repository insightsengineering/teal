## Introduction

`teal` leverages the [Shiny module](https://rstudio.github.io/shiny/reference/moduleServer.html) concept to enable seamless communication between the framework and `teal` modules, while also promoting encapsulation.

`teal` modules heavily depends on this core Shiny feature and is a powerful extension that allows for a seamless

## Benefits

The shiny module technique provides an efficient and structured approach when developing large shiny apps.
By incorporating the shiny module concept into `teal`, developers can break down complex functionalities into smaller, more manageable modules, encapsulating specific functionality within each module.

This encapsulation ensures that the variables, functions, and logic within a module are self-contained and independent from other parts of the application.
As a result, developers can focus on building self-contained components within each module, making it easier to understand, test, and enhance different aspects of the application independently.

By embracing encapsulation through shiny modules, `teal` **empowers developers to** create modular and maintainable shiny apps, enhancing code organization and facilitating collaboration.
