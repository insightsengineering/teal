## Introduction

Reproducibility is paramount in the pharmaceutical industry.
Accurate and consistent results are essential to ensure high-quality research and the safety of patients.
By prioritizing reproducibility, researchers can validate their methods, confirm their findings, and contribute to the advancement of the field.

[`qenv`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.code/latest-tag/articles/qenv.html) is an essential feature provided by the `teal.code` package that facilitates code reproducibility.
It is a class that stores both data and code, which enables tracking of the analytical process, and thus allows for sharing and replication of R code.
Code is passed to a `qenv` object, where it is evaluated in a specific environment and stored, and can be retrieved on request.

## `qenv` in a `teal` application

In a `teal` application, a `qenv` object is created by the module developer in the module's server function. All data operations and their R code are appended and stored within the `qenv`'s environment, which allows for the code to be evaluated and executed in the `teal` application, and reproduced outside the `teal` application. This includes data loading, preprocessing, filtering, transformations, and plotting, etc.

The `qenv` object makes it easy for users to reproduce and validate the results of their analyses.

```{dot qenv_dot_diagram, echo=FALSE}
digraph G {
    qenv [label = "qenv"];
    node [shape=box];
    teal_modules [label = "teal modules analysis R code"];
    library [label = "R library() calls"];
    filter_states [label = "filter states R code"];
    data [label = "data preprocessing R code"];
    teal_modules -> qenv;
    library -> qenv;
    edge [dir="back"];
    qenv -> filter_states;
    qenv -> data;
}
```

## `Show R Code` and `Reporter`

In both the `teal.modules.clinical` and `teal.modules.general` R packages, you'll find that most modules include a convenient `Show R Code`button.
When this button is clicked, a modal window appears, revealing the R code responsible for generating the module's output.
This functionality is achieved by inspecting the qenv object, which contains the stored code.
With the Show R Code button, users can now easily copy and independently run the code to reproduce the same analysis presented in the teal module.

The Reporter feature also leverages the qenv object in its operation.
Much like the Show R Code mechanism, the code displayed in a Reporter Card is extracted from the qenv object.

To learn more about the `Reporter` feature, please visit the [teal.reporter documentation](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal.reporter/latest-tag/index.html).

Overall, `qenv` from `teal.code` is a powerful tool for ensuring code reproducibility and promoting high-quality research in the R programming language.
