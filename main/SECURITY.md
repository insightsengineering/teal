## Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any of the
repositories in this organization, please report it to us through
coordinated disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub
issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please send an email to vulnerability.management\[@\]roche.com.

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to
help us better understand and resolve the issue:

- The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site
  scripting)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct
  URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.
