Added new functions csv_dataset_connector csv_cdisc_dataset_connector. Updated set_ui_input method RawDatasetConnector NamedDatasetConnector handle user defined shiny inputs. Include Keep Inf checkbox numerical filter items. Keep NA Keep Inf checkbox doesn’t appear missing infinite values. Replace existing RelationalData class abstract class RelationalDataCollection rename RelationalDataList class RelationalData. data argument teal::init now always RelationalData object. Added fun_cdisc_dataset_connector enable providing custom function returning dataset. Removed code script arguments as_relational wrapper. intended done mutate_dataset functionality. filer argument init added validation step ensure compatibility rest app. Variables inherited ADSL specified ADSL dataset.
