# About Technical Blueprint

Welcome to `teal` Technical Blueprint documentation!

The purpose of this material is to aid new developer’s comprehension of
the fundamental principles of the `teal` framework. We will explore
crucial `teal` concepts such as data flow, actors, and filter panel,
among others.

While this material will be presented at a high-level, we will direct
you to our vignettes for a more in-depth understanding.

Our hope is that this resource will provide new developers with a strong
grasp of `teal` products, enabling them to contribute to code with
confidence.
