# teal 0.12.0.9017

### Major breaking changes

* The use of `datasets` argument in `modules` has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please use `data` argument instead. `data` is of type `tdata`; see "Creating custom modules" vignettes and function documentation of `teal::new_tdata` for further details.

### Breaking changes

* Due to deprecation of `chunks` in `teal.code`, the `teal` framework now uses their replacement (`qenv`) instead. The documentation in `teal` has been updated to reflect this and custom modules written with `chunks` should be updated to use `qenv`.

### New features

* Added the `validate_inputs` and `validate_inputs_segregated` functions that transfer input validation messages to app output.
* `modules` argument of `init` accepts `teal_module` type of object. There is no need to wrap up a single module in `modules()` or `list()`.

### Miscellaneous

* Updated examples to use `scda.2022`.
* Added R session information into a link in the footer of `teal` applications.
* Added data hashing step using `rlang` instead of `digest` package to calculate the hash (which has been moved from `teal.data` and `teal.slice`). There is now an explicit hashing check in the reproducible code output.
* Removed deprecated functions: `root_modules`, `default_filter`, `bookmarkableShinyApp`, as well as deprecated logging mechanism, including the functions `log_app_usage` and `.log`.
* Updated the "Teal and Bootstrap Themes" vignette to provide more details customizing a `teal` app with `bslib::run_with_themer`.

# teal 0.12.0

### New features

* Added the support for custom `bslib` bootstrap themes in `teal::init` apps, please read more in the new `teal-bs-themes` vignette.

### Enhancements

* Added the option to choose which variables can be filtered in the filter panel by using the `filterable` attributes for the per-dataset lists in the `filter` argument of `init`.
* Updated `teal_module` to have `data` argument which receives a list of reactive filter data with `"code"` and `"join_keys"` attributes.
* Updated `teal_module` to have `filter_panel_api` argument which receives a `FilterPanelAPI` object.
* Updated the internals of `module_teal` to reflect changes in `teal.slice`.

### Breaking changes

* Updated `teal_module` to no longer receive `datasets` object in the `...` argument. In order to use `datasets` in the `teal_module` please specify `datasets` explicitly.
* Deprecated `merge_expression` argument in `get_rcode_srv` function and removed it in `get_rcode` function.
* Deprecated `session` argument in `get_rcode` function.

# Miscellaneous

* Enhanced the burger button so it is disabled when the filter panel is not used.

# teal 0.11.1

### Enhancements
* Added new function `reporter_previewer_module` to wrap the `teal.reporter` package previewer functionality as a `teal` module.
* Updated `teal` to support `modules` which include reporting. If any `module` which supports reporting is included then a `reporter_previewer_module` is included.
* Added default arguments to `module()` and the `server` argument is now a function where the second argument can be `...` or `datasets`.

### Breaking changes
* Deprecated `bookmarkableShinyApp`. In future releases the `teal` framework will stop supporting shiny bookmarking (which has not officially been supported); it may be officially supported in the future. Note the filter panel in `teal.slice` retains its ability to save and restore its state if used in a standalone `shiny` app with bookmarking.

### Miscellaneous
* Added a template to the `pkgdown` configuration.
* Removed unneeded `shinytest` app tests.
* Updated package authors.
* Added package vignettes.

# teal 0.11.0

* `teal.data`: creating and loading the data needed for `teal` applications.
* `teal.widgets`: shiny components used within `teal`.
* `teal.slice`: provides a filtering panel to allow filtering of data.
* `teal.code`: handles reproducibility of outputs.
* `teal.transform`: standardizes extracting and merging data.
* `teal.logger`: standardizes logging within `teal` framework.

The `teal` package contains the code to create apps (`teal::init`), to create a module (`teal::module`) and to group modules in the app (`teal::modules`).
`teal` depends on `teal.transform` and `teal.data` which contain the functions that `teal` app creators are likely to need. The other package `teal` only imports from and therefore `teal` module creators should either fully specify functions from these packages when required or import them into custom packages as `library(teal)` will not load them.

### New features
* A simple new `teal` module named `example_module` has been included in the package.

### Breaking changes
* `teal` package has been split into multiple smaller packages, see above.
* Deprecated `root_modules` function, users should use `modules` directly inside `init`.
* Due to deprecation of `root_modules` any `label` argument to `modules` must be explicitly named. For example `modules("lab", mod1, mod2)` should be replaced with `modules(label = "lab", mod1, mod2)`.

### Miscellaneous
* Minor changes to internals of `teal`: main module panel now has fixed shiny name `root` and the active tab is named `active_tab` not `Active_tab`.
* `MultiAssayExperiment` is now suggested packages, not required. Objects dependent on `MultiAssayExperiment` are changed to lazy-load this now suggested package.

### Bug fixes
* Showing R Code no longer shows reproducibility warning message if reproducibility check has passed.

# teal 0.10.1
### Breaking changes
* Changed the `HTML` identifiers of `teal` modules - now each nested module receives its own `shiny` namespace.
* Deprecated all functions related to connectors that have been moved to their own separate packages.
* Removed `raw_dataset`, `raw_dataset_connector`, `named_dataset`, `named_dataset_file`, `named_dataset_connector`, `relational_dataset`, `relational_dataset_file`, `relational_dataset_connector`, `key`, `as_cdisc`, `as_cdisc_relational`.
* Removed `rcd_connection` and `rcd_data`; `scda_dataset_connectors` can be passed into `cdisc_data` and `teal_data` directly.
* Replaced `rcd_dataset_connector` and `rcd_cdisc_dataset_connector` with `scda_dataset_connector` and `scda_cdisc_dataset_connector` respectively.
* Renamed `teal_show_js_log` option into `teal.show_js_log` to match options naming convention.
* Removed `%is_in%` and `stop_shiny` internal utility functions.

### New features
#### Logging
* Added support for logging using the `logger` package.
* Added a new function `register_logger`, which registers a logger in a given namespace.
* Added trace and info levels log messages to the `teal` framework.
* Added `pid` and shiny session token into footnote so app developers can identify logs for apps.

#### Other
* Added print methods to the `DatasetConnector`, `RelationalData`, `RelationalDataconnector` and `JoinKeys` classes and added input validation to the implementation of the print method that was already in the `Dataset` object.

* Added public facing constructor functions for `CDISCDataConnector`, `RelationalDataConnector`, and `DataConnection` classes.
* Modified `data_extract_spec` to allow both the `filter` and `select` parameters to be `NULL`, which results in the `data_extract_ui` acting as if a `filter_spec` with all variables as possible choices had been supplied as the `filter` argument and a `select_spec` with the `multiple` parameter set to `TRUE` had been supplied as the `select` argument.
* Added support of the full screen for a `module` when the `filters` argument is equal `NULL`.
* Added support for `shiny::moduleServer` passed to the `server` parameter of `teal::module`.
* Added `teal.threshold_slider_vs_checkboxgroup` as an R option: if a categorical variable has more than this number of unique values, the filter panel uses a drop-down select input instead of a checkbox group.
* Extended the `FilteredData` API to allow managing filter states programmatically and not only from the UI of a `teal` application.
* Hid the buttons to remove filters from all datasets and each dataset when there are no active filters.
* Updated `init` to accept `RelationalData`, `data.frame`, `MultiAssayExperiment`, `Dataset`, `DatasetConnector`, `list` or a function returning a named list as data input.

### Bug fixes
* `choices_selected` now correctly removes duplicates from the array passed to its `choices` parameter.
* Fixed call returned by `FilterState` in case of using `MultiAssayExperiment::subsetByColData`. Now single condition for variable containing `NA` values is `!is.na(var) & var == <condition>`.
* Fixed data loading of `DatasetConnector` being dependent on other `Dataset` or `DatasetConnector` objects.
* Fixed restoring a bookmarked filter state of `teal` application.
* Refactored `module_nested_tabs` to fix the issue with the filter panel not reacting to an input change in a nested module.
* `updateOptionalSelectInput` no longer sets input to `NULL` when `logical` value is passed to `selected`.
* Fixed setting `JoinKeys` when key name between two `Dataset` object differs.
* Fixed printing of the `JavaScript` console logs to the `R` console when `teal.show_js_log = TRUE`.

### Miscellaneous
* Soft-deprecate `mae_dataset()` in favor of more general `dataset()` constructor.
* Added a vignette describing the modifications to `teal` applications users can apply using `R` options.
* Added default values to the `label` argument of `select_spec` and `filter_spec`.
* Added validation to `FilteredDataset::get_data` to accept logical input only.
* Changed references to outdated functions of `teal.devel` in the documentation.
* Introduced a `Teal` prefix to all public `R6` classes to avoid name collisions with other packages.
* Removed dependency on `utils.nest` and replaced its functionality in `teal` with equivalents from the `checkmate` package and base `R`.
* Replaced the old `shiny` server functions of `DataConnection`, `RelationalDataConnector`, `DatasetConnector`, and `RelationalData` with the `shiny::moduleServer` equivalents.
* Running a `teal` application via `ui_teal_with_splash` and `srv_teal_with_splash` is now no longer recommended because it doesn't support new features (e.g. logging, bookmarking). Use `init` instead.
* Updated the R version requirement to >= 4.0.
* Updated the "filter panel collapse" icon to remove warnings when using `shiny` version >= 1.7.
* Removed some of the non-exported, debugging modules.
* Updated the footer tag style to be less visible.

# teal 0.10.0

### New features
* Allow passing `MultiAssayExperiment` to the `teal::init` using `mae_dataset` function or through
the connectors.
* Refactored filter panel to use `MultiAssayExperiment` objects. Filters can be set on a subject level

* Added `cdse_dataset_connector` to create delayed data objects from `CDSE`.
* Added `datasetdb_dataset_connector` to create delayed data objects from `DataSetDB`.
* Added `ricepass_connection` to create delayed data objects from `entimICE` via `ricepass`.

    * Simplified setting of initial filter state without need to specify "choices" or "range" named list element depending on the variable class.
    * `Dataset` type determines an appearance and a functionality of related filters and filters summary.
    * `Datasets` are passed (by reference) from `DDL` to `FilteredData` skipping extracting data and
    their attributes.
    * Redesigned variable filter labels in "Active Filter Variables" panel.
    * Fully testable server functions.

### Bug fixes
* Fixed the bug caused by calling `mutate_dataset` multiple times on the same `DatasetConnector` or `Dataset` object.
* Fixed a bug that caused the output of `get_code` function to not reproduce its raw data set.
* Changed `filter_spec` to allow no variable selection upon app initialization, where the first possible value was previously selected.

### Enhancements
* `modules` parameter of `teal::init` function can also receive a `list` except `root_modules`
function call.
* Added `split` and `merge` methods to the `JoinKeys` object.
* Added `all_choices()` as a possible argument to the `selected` parameter of `filter_spec`, `select_spec` and `choices_selected` indicating that all choices are selected.
* The `append` method of a `CodeClass` object has been modified to print a warning message when the argument does not result in any code being added because it is duplicated.
* Implemented delayed functionality to the mutate method of the `Dataset` and `DatasetConnector` objects.
* Modified `teal_data` to return a `CDISCData` object whenever any of its arguments is a type of `CDISCData` object.

### Miscellaneous
* Updated `LICENCE` and `README` with new package references.
* Added a method `get_hash` to the `Dataset` class returning the MD5 hash of the object stored inside the `Dataset` object.
* Replaced `random.cdisc.data` with `scda` in examples and tests.
* Implemented functionality to store `JoinKeys` in `Dataset` and `DatasetConnector` classes.
* Added `error_on_lintr: TRUE` to `.lintr`

* Removed hyperlinks to the `rice` package from the documentation.

# teal 0.9.5

### Enhancements
* Added informational stop message when using `mutate_data` with `RelationalDataConnector`.
* Modified `as_cdisc` to behave similarly to `cdisc_dataset` when called on a `Dataset` object.
* Changed the displayed format of the data name and the column name in `data_extract_spec` UI elements. Both are now compressed to `<data name>.<column name>` if they don't change during runtime of the app.
* Added `ADSAFTTE` to the list of recognized ADaM dataset names.
* Added another example to `data_extract_spec`'s doc string showcasing app users can choose a variable used for filtering in the encoding panel.
* Added CSS styling to tool tips in teal modules.

### Bug fixes
* Fixed an edge case error when creating a filter on variable with all missing values crashed the app.
* Fixed a bug that crashes app whenever a `Date` or `datetime` column is selected from a `filter_spec`.

# teal 0.9.4

### Enhancements
* Released `snowflake` connection and connectors.
* Changed ordering of datasets to be more intuitive (topologically first for CDISC datasets only and then according to input datasets order).
* When closing a teal app (ending a user shiny session), all `DataConnection`s will now try to close their connections.
* Added ADHY keys to configuration file.
* Extended the `filter_spec` function: the parameter `choices` is no longer mandatory (the function will take all possible choices by default) and the `vars` parameter additionally accepts the `choices_selected` and allows to change the variables for filtering using the UI elements in the encoding panel.

### Bug fixes
* Cleaned up imports in the package.
* Modified `value_choices` function to handle edge case when `"NA"` and  `NA` values exist in the `character` column that choices are derived from.\
* Fixed issue with cloning `Callable` class.

# teal 0.9.3

### New Features
* Support for data-standard independent input and filtering. That includes refactor of the all data and dataset structures together with refactor of `FilteredData` class.
* New `JoinKeys` class (with `join_keys()` constructors and `join_key()` constructor for its elements) to store joining key columns between datasets.
* Refactored the most basic `dataset()` constructor, added `cdisc_dataset()` constructor and `as_cdisc()` conversion function.
* Soft-deprecate removed class constructors and obsolete functions (e.g. `keys()`).
* Added `get_keys()` and `set_keys()` functions to extract and manipulate datasets primary keys respectively.
* Unexported `filtered_data_new`, `filtered_data_set` and `filtered_data_set_filters`.

### Bug fixes
* Duplicated lines of code passed to `teal::cdisc_dataset` and other `teal::RelationalDataset` constructors should now be shown when getting the code from `teal::cdisc_data` objects and other `teal::RelationalData` objects.
* Added ability to press "Enter" key without having to set focus to the Submit button for delayed data loading.
* Allow `variable_choices` to use datasets with missing labels.
* Fixed bug that ignores input of `NULL` to `selected` argument of `select_spec` function.

### Enhancements
* Added button to remove all active filters from the Filter Panel.

# teal 0.9.2

### New Features
* Added `python_dataset_connector` to create delayed data objects from python scripts or directly from python code.
* NOTE: `python_dataset_connector` is not yet ready to be deployed on RSConnect because it does not contain `numpy` and `pandas`, which are `Python` libraries used in `python_dataset_connector`.
* Added support for filtering on `Date` and `Datetime` variables in the Filter Panel.
* Added buttons for `date` and `datetime` filter widgets to reset the value to the original.
* Added new function `check_key_duplicates`, which creates a short summary about rows with duplicated primary key (row numbers and the number of duplicates)

### Enhancements
* Fixed lack of labels for `character` and `factor` variables in the Filter Panel.
* All variables are now displayed in `module_filter_panel`, not only those of types `numeric`, `logical`, `factor`, `character` and `Date`
* Fixed `mutate_data` to accept the whole scope of objects for `vars`.
* Clarified `teal::init` function documentation to state that custom css loading code with `htmltools::htmlDependency` should be included in the `header` argument rather than inside `ui` arguments of modules.
* Enabled empty select field inside `data_extract_spec`.
* Added new argument `drop_keys` to `filter_spec` to decide whether to drop or keep keys columns on single filter on those columns.
* Added a new optional argument `keys` to `variable_choices`. `keys` specifies the names of the variables, which should have the new key icon shown next to them in the variable drop down menus in the left-hand side encoding panels instead of the icon appropriate for their original R variable type. `variable_choices` now also works with `RelationalDataset` and `RelationalDatasetConnector` objects.

### Miscellaneous
* Removed `include_factors` option in `get_class_colnames` in `RawDataset`.

# teal 0.9.1

* Adds method to resolve nested lists containing delayed data objects, which can be used for `arm_ref_comp` objects.
* Nested tabs module now has better alignment with the filter panel on the page.
* Allow `width` argument in `optionalSelectInput`.
* Added lifecycle badges to all exported functions.
* Added new `code_dataset_connector` and `code_cdisc_dataset_connector` functions which enable the creation of new delayed data objects given a string of code.
* Added new functions `csv_dataset_connector` and `csv_cdisc_dataset_connector`.
* Updated `set_ui_input` method of `RawDatasetConnector` and `NamedDatasetConnector` to handle user defined shiny inputs.
* Include `Keep Inf` checkbox for numerical filter items. `Keep NA` and `Keep Inf` checkbox doesn't appear if there are no missing or infinite values.
* Replace existing `RelationalData` class with abstract class `RelationalDataCollection` and rename `RelationalDataList` class as `RelationalData`. The `data` argument to `teal::init` is now always a `RelationalData` object.
* Added `fun_cdisc_dataset_connector` to enable providing a custom function which returning a dataset.
* Removed `code` and `script` arguments from `as_relational` wrapper. This is intended to be done with `mutate_dataset` functionality.
* `filer` argument in `init` has added a validation step to ensure compatibility with the rest of the app. Variables inherited from ADSL have to be specified only for ADSL dataset.
* Fixes the issue with connection close code not being present in `get_code` results.
* Fixes the issue of occasional incorrect ordering of bar charts on the filter panel.
* More informative error displayed when `pull_fun` of `DataConnection` produces an error.

# teal 0.9.0

* `cdisc_dataset` and `dataset` now return R6 class objects (`RelationalDataset`).
* A new `teal_data` function to include datasets and connectors into teal application.
* `cdisc_data` function to include datasets and connectors into teal application where a `check` argument still could be used and other consistency tests are performed.
* `get_raw_data` can be used to derive raw data from R6 objects e.g. (`RelationalDataset`).
* `RawDatasetConnector`, `NamedDatasetConnector` and `RelationalDatasetConnector` to execute custom function call in order to get data from connection.
* `CodeClass` to manage reproducibility of the data and relationships between datasets. Not directly exposed to the public interface.
* `mutate_dataset` allows to modify dataset or connector via `code` argument or an R script.
* `mutate_data` allows to change any dataset in `RelationalData`, `RelationalDataConnector` or `RelationalDataList`.
* New wrapper functions to manipulate `RelationalDatasetConnector` and `RelationalDataset` such as `get_dataset`, `load_dataset`, `as_relational`.
* New wrapper functions to manipulate `RelationalDataConnector`, `RelationalData` and `RelationalDataList` such as `get_datasets`, `load_datasets`.
* `choices_labeled`, `filter_spec`, `select_spec`, `data_extract_spec`, `value_choices`,
`variable_choices` as S3 class applied on `data.frame` and also on delayed data.

* You can no longer modify the `app$datasets`, but must instead use argument `filter` in the `init` function.
* New modules were created to create a module of nested teal modules, then another one that adds the right filter pane to each tab. The `teal::init` function stays unchanged.
* The `teal::init` function now returns a `UI` function with an optional `id` argument. This allows to embed it into other applications. A split view of two teal applications side-by-side is one such example and shown in a vignette. `teal::init` was turned into a wrapper function around `module_teal_with_splash.R` and developers that want to embed teal as a Shiny module should directly work with these functions (`ui_teal_with_splash` and `srv_teal_with_splash`) instead of `teal::init`.
* The `teal::init` function now has a title parameter to set the title of the browser window.
* Missing data `NA` is now explicitly addressed in the filter panel: `NA`s are excluded by default and a checkbox to include them was added.
* Statistics of the data are visually depicted in terms of histograms or bar charts overlayed onto the Shiny input elements.
* Added buttons to remove all filters applied to a dataset.
* Restored the functionality to hide the filter panel for a module when it was constructed with `filters = NULL`.
* Moved helper functions into `utils.nest` and removed unused functions `set_labels_df` and `get_labels_df`.
* `optionalSelectInput` now allows for grouped choices.

## Refactor of `FilteredData` (for developers)

* `FilteredData` is now fully reactive. Now filtered data is lazy evaluated as per need. This further opens the door to bookmarking `teal` apps (bookmarking currently works for the right filtering panel, but we will make this feature more sophisticated in a future release, each module must be reviewed and adapted if it contains `reactiveValues`).
* Datasets and materialized connectors are provided to `FilteredData` by `set_datasets_data` function located in `init_datasets.R` file.
* Renamed `get_dataset()` method to `get_data()`.
* Renamed `get_filter_call()` method to `get_filter_expr()`; returns an expression rather than a list.
* Removed argument `isolate` from `get_data()` method and similar methods. You must `isolate` it yourself as needed. If you want to temporarily deactivate Shiny errors due to missing errors, you can set `options(shiny.suppressMissingContextError = TRUE)`. In general, avoid `isolate` as this breaks reactivity.
* We added a development module to add several filters at once, e.g. safety filters. This is to be evaluated before it is converted into a proper module and made available to end-users.


# teal 0.8.5

* UI bug fix to hide filter elements for not used datasets.

# teal 0.8.4

* Progress bar for ui creation in delayed loading module.
* Change output of `keys` function to `keys` object.

 * `tm_scatterplot` module.
 * `tm_table` module.

#### Changes

 * All `tabs` arguments were renamed to `modules`.
 * `tab_item` function is now called `module`.
 * `tab_items` function is now called `modules`.
 * `tabs` function was removed.
 * `variable_browser_item` is now called `tm_variable_browser`.
